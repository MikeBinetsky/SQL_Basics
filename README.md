# sql-challenge

This is my submission for the SQL challenge.

The first thing I do is lay out my tables in the an ERD to see how they connect to each other.

From there, using pgAdmin I create my tables and, using my ERD, use foreign keys to relate them to each other.

After that, I import my data in order to maintain the key order in the table creation. 

Finally, I perform a series of queries to get the desired data below:

 1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.

 2. List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.

 3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.

 4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

 5. List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

 6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

 7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

 8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
